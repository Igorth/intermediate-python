# Intermediate Python Concepts

Welcome to the Intermediate Python repository! This repository contains examples and explanations of various intermediate Python concepts to help you deepen your understanding of the language. Whether you're preparing for job interviews, enhancing your coding skills, or just exploring advanced Python topics, this repository is a valuable resource.

This repository is part of my journey to gain programming knowledge and improve my Python skills. By exploring these intermediate concepts, I aim to become a more proficient Python developer.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intermediate-python.git
   cd intermediate-python
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the concept you want to learn about.
3. Open the Python file and follow the code along with the comments and explanations.
4. Run the examples on your local machine to see how they work in practice.

## Examples and Explanations

### \*args and \*\*kwargs

[\*args and \*\*kwargs](./args_kwargs/playground.py) allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. This is useful when you do not know beforehand how many arguments will be passed to your function.

### Class Inheritance

[Class Inheritance](./class_inherirance/main.py) enables you to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. It promotes code reuse and makes it easier to create and maintain complex systems.

### List Comprehensions

[List Comprehensions](./list_comprehensions/main.py) provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses.

### Mutable and Immutable

[Mutable and Immutable](./mutable_immutable/main.py) data types are crucial concepts in Python. Mutable objects can change their value, while immutable objects cannot.

### Pass by Value, Pass by Reference, and Pass by Object

[Pass by Value, Pass by Reference, and Pass by Object](./pass_by_object_reference/main.py) explain how data is passed to functions in Python. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and bug-free code.

### Reading and Writing Files

[Reading and Writing Files](./reading_writing_files/main.py) in Python is a common task. This example shows how to handle files using built-in functions.

### Side Effects

[Side Effects](./side_effects/main.py) occur when a function modifies some state or interacts with outside functions or variables. Understanding side effects is important for debugging and writing predictable code.

### Shallow Copy and Deep Copy

[Shallow Copy and Deep Copy](./side_effects/main.py) explain the differences between copying objects. Shallow copies create a new object, but it inserts references into the original object, while deep copies create a new object and recursively add copies of nested objects.

### Slicing Lists and Tuples

[Slicing Lists and Tuples](./slicing/main.py) is a method for extracting parts of lists and tuples. This example covers basic and advanced slicing techniques.

### Try Catch

[Try Catch](./try_catch/main.py) in Python is used to handle exceptions and errors gracefully. This example shows how to use try-except blocks to manage exceptions.

### Decorators

[Decorators](./decorators/main.py) are a powerful and expressive tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of functions or classes. This example demonstrates how to create and use decorators.

### Lambda Functions

[Lambda Functions](./lambda/main.py) are small anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. This example shows how to use lambda functions effectively.
